# Ukraine

I've been asked about my views on Ukraine, and US aid to Ukraine. I have a _lot_ of opinions on this; too many to capture.

## Background

I am not your typical American.

Before addressing the questions, let me give a sense of how I come to these views.

In 1970, I wrote Senator Harold Hughes (IA-D), asking for a subscription to the Congressional Record. That was my firehose introduction to a legislative-oriented view of the US political process. By the time I left for MIT in 1972, I had amased a wall of cheap newsprint, bound with staples, more arriving on a nearly weekly basis. Filled with minutae, bills,grandstanding, they varried from a slim ¼ inch to many times that, depending largely on what materials members of Congress chose to "read" into the record (i.e. ordered inserted into the Record as if read).

In 1971, Daniel Elseberg, a senior research associate at MIT's Center for International Studies, leaked the [Pentagon Papers](https://www.archives.gov/research/pentagon-papers) to the New York Times and the Washington Post. While these papers were tied up in the courts over prior restraint, Ellsberg passed a copy to Senator Mike Gravel (AK-D). Denied the opportunity to read the on the floor, he convened a subcommitte hearing in which he read them into the record, followed by [this emotional commentary](https://youtu.be/bWwDGvBSUYk) (which I did not discover until the Era of YouTube).

The relevance of this background will become clear further along.

I opposed the Vietnam war. I oppose all war. The relevance of this will become clear further along.

## How do I feel about the American people being ask to spend fund Ukraine's defense?

Let's leave the question of how I feel about the war for later questions, and focus here on putting this in context. I'll use just federal military and humanitarian aid; there are other expenditures, but they're hard to track.

Big numbers are scary. But it's a big, wealthy country; the world's largest economy, so we need some benchmarks for comparison.

So we can think of $1B as about the cost of an 850 MW power plant, like Russia is blowing up in Ukraine, or about 37% of the wealth of any one of the people at the bottom of the Forbes 400 list.

When I was born in 1954, the top marginal tax rate in the US was 91%. Today, it stands at 37%. The 1950s were a period of economic expansion, building new, affordable homes, expanding our infrastructure. The richest person in America was Texas oilman H.L. Hunt. His income was estimated in 1954 at $2b, or about $21.8 Billion in 2022 dollars. This would put him at #28 on the Forbes 400 list.

We have an oligarch problem that dwarf's Russia's in scale. But when the Soviet Union disolved, and its public assets privatized into a few hands, it was taken from a smaller economy, ad resulted in a much greater concentration of power. When Putin became President of Russia in 2000, I was concerned. That was magnified when he traded offices with Medvedev, becoming Prime Minister, then President again, to evade the constitutional limitation on consequetive terms.

Any hopes that Russia would finally join the world w/ a functioning democracy were dashed when Putin got his constitutional amendment in 2020 allowing him to retain power.

When Russia seized Crimea in 2014, it became clear that Putin sought to recreate imperial Russia.

When Russia expanded its invasion in February 2022, the question became, "Is there room in the modern world for imperialism?".

I believe the answer to be a resounding "No".

Putin's power rests on direct or indirect control of its extraction industries, especially oil and gas, and on much of its domestic life, including the media. Independent media faced competition from state-owned media, or were swallowed up by Gazprom Media, with significant state ownership and control.

For me, as an anti-war person, the issue boils down to two issues:

* War is bad
* Imperialism is the source of most non-civil wars.

I'm not going to dive into imperialism here. For our purpose here, I mean it broadly. Land grabs are the most blatant example.

And yes, I am deeply aware of the United States' history of imperialism. I could rant about the Dulles brothers all day long, but the United States itself is the result of a long series of land grabs. The overthrow of the Hawaian monarchy, engineered by the Dulles brothers' grandfather, John Foster, or the territories we acquired via the Spanish American War, are the last, depending on how we count.
